## Tidying up with Marie Kondo ##

### Highlights from the book ###
+ A dramatic reorganization of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective. It is life transforming.

+ Basically, when you put your house in order, you put your affaris and your past in order, too.
+ When a room becomes cluttered, the cause is more than just physical. Visible mess helps distract us from the true source of the disorder.
+ Putting things away creates the illusion that the clutter problem has been solved. _take on tranditional cleaning by stuffing in the closet_
+ _on cleaning by room, living room, then bedroom_ When we disperse storage of a particular item throughout the house and tidy one place at a time, we can never grasp the overall volumen and therefore can never finish. To escape this negative spiral, tidy by category, not by place.
+ _why looking all clothes/things you own, should be gathered in once place before discarding_ The key is to make the change so sudden that you experience a complete chagne of heart. The same impact can never be acheived if the process is gradual.
+ Tidy in the right order...Do not even think of putting your things away until you have finished the process of discarding.
+ _on how you should imagine a place before starting the process_ Think in concrete terms so that you can vividly picture what it would be like to live in a clutter-free space.
+ _before starting, ask why you want to live in clean place_ Maybe yoru answers will be "I don't want to be tired when I go to work the next day." ....Ask yourself "why?" again, for each answer. Repeat this process three or five itmes for every item...you will come to simple realization. The whoel point in both discarding and keeping things is to be happy.
+ **However, the moment you start focusing on how to choose what to throw away, you have actually veered significantly off course.**
+ We should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of...Take each item in one's hand and ask: "Does this spark joy?" If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it...If you can do it alone.
+ When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You'll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role. By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order.
+ If things had feeling, they would certainly not be happy. Free them from the prison to which you have relegated them. Help them leave that deserted isle to which you have exiled them. Let them go, with gratitude. Not only you, but your things as well, will feel clear and refreshed when you are done tidying.
+ Make sure you gather every piee of clothing in the house and be sure to handle each one.
+ The act of folding is far more than making clothes compact for storage. It is an act of caring, and expression of love and appreciation for the way these clothes support your lifestyle.
+ Clothes, like people, can relax more freely when in the company of others who are very similar in type, and therefore organizing them by category heps them feel more comfortable...Arrange your clothes so that ehy rise to the right...Hang heavy items on the left side of the closet and light items on the right.
+ Just aim to make a simple rectangle, the key to folding.
+ _for books_ Instead, take each book in your hand and decide whether it moves you or not. Keep only those books that will make you happy just to see them on your shelves, the ones that you really love.
+ _some refrence you been keeping_ He gave the classic answer from my list of most probable answers: "Because I might want to read it sometime." I'm afraid that from personal experience I can tell you right now, "sometime" never comes. _painfully true in my experience too_
+ For books, timing is everything. The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it. To avoid missing that moment, I recommend that you keep your collection small.
+ _on papers_ I recommend you dispose of anything that does not fall into one of three categories: Currently in use, needed for a limited period of time, or must be kept indefinitely.
+ Make sure that you keep all such papers in one spot only. Never let them spread to other parts of the house.I recommend using a vertical organier in which papers can be stored standing up and designating a specific place for it.
+ Papers are organized into three categories: **needs attention**, should be saved (contratual documents), and should be saved (others).
+ _Komono(miscellaneous items)_ Keep thing because you love them-not "just because"
+ _on gifts_ But surely the person who gave it to you doesn't want you to use it out of sense of obligation, or to put it away without using it, only to feel guilty every time you see it.
+ It is not our memories but the person we have become of those past experiences, that we should treasure.
+ The secret to maintaining an uncluttered room is to pursue ulitmate simplicity in storage so that you can tell at a glance how much you have.
+ _on storing_ **Store all items of the same type in the same place and don't scatter storage space.** ...each person have own space is preferable.
+ Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong._their home_ Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out.
+ Empty your bag everyday.
+ If you are going to buy clothes, choose them with the intention of welcoming them into your home and caring for them.
+ _on why visible letter should be removed_ By eliminating excess visual information that doesn't inspire joy, you can make your space much more peaceful and comfortable.
+ One of the homework assignments I give my clients is to **appreciate their belongings.** For example, I urge them to try saying, "Thank you for keeping me warm all day," when they hang up clothes after returning home...I began to treat my belongings as if they were alive. _not necessary but helps_
+ One of the magical effects of tidying is confidence in your decision-making capacity. _remember question, does it spark a joy?_
+ "Am I having trouble getting rid of this because of an attachment to the past or because of a fear for the future?"
+ _on not finding things you would have otherwise kept for rainy day_ Most of them laugh and say, "For a moment I thought I was in trouble, but then I realized it wasn't life threatening."
+ Life becomes easier once you know that things will still work out even if you are lacking something.
+ It's a strange phemomenon, but when we reduce what we own and essentially "detox" our house, it has a detox effect on our bodies as well.
+ _on keeping things you value_ If you can say without a doubt, "I really like this!" no matter what anyone else says, and if you like yourself for having it, then ignore what other people think.
