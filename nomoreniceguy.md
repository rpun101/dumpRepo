# No more Nice Guy #
_written in male perspective. It appeals to become a man from boy. to get rid of unhealthy thinking, toxic mentality towards more equal thinking, and taking care of yourself. some ideas are extreme so should take it with grain of salt. It definitely has good ideas._

Also criticism of this book by [this article](https://thepowermoves.com/no-more-mr-nice-guy/) is valid. I agree with that.

### nice guy ###
> Crux of nice guy: `They all believe that if they are 'good' and do everything 'right' they will be loved, get their needs met, and have a problem-free life.`

+ __DEER__(Defend, Explain, Excuse, Rationalize) Response
    + all fear-based behaviors used to distract others from focusing on the _nice Guy's_ mistakes and 'badness'

## 4 - Make Your Needs a Priority ##

+ Survival Mechanisms
    + Trying to appear needless and want-less
    + making it difficult for other to give to them(compliments)
    + Using "covert contracts" **classic r/niceguy example**
    + Caretaking-focusing attention on other people's needs [too much]
+ > Covert Contract: *I will do this __  for you, so that you will do this __ for me.*

+ Victim Triangle
    + nice guy do thing hoping to get something in return
    + keeps giving but doesn't get proportional returns
    + eventually, released in the form of *rage attacks*, passive-aggressive behavior, pouting, shaming, blaming, even physical abuse.
+ Caretaking
    + gives to other what the giver needs to give
    + comes from place of emptiness within the giver
    + always has unconscious strings attached

+ Caring
    + Give to other what the receiver needs
    + comes from a place of abundance within the giver
    + Has no string attached
+ Taking responsibility for their own need helps nice guys get their needs met. Start belief
    + having needs is part of human
    + Mature people make meeting their own needs a priority
    + They can ask for help in meeting their needs in clear and direct ways
    + Other people really do want to help them meet their needs
    + this world is a place of abundance

## Reclaim Your Personal Power ##
+ Surrendering
    + means _letting go of wat one can't change and changing what one can._
+ Dwelling in reality
+ Expressing feeling
    + check your emotion and say what you feel
    + Guidelines
        + Don't focus on other person, "You are making me mad." Instead, take responsibility for what you are feeling, "I am feeling angry."
        + Don't use feeling words to describe what you are thinking, as in "I feel like Joe was trying to take advantage of me." Instead pay attention to what you are experiencing in your body, *"I'm feeling helpless and frightened."*
        + In general, try to begin feeling statements with "I", rather than "you."
+ Facing fears
    + Suffering because they:
        + avoid new situations
        + stay with he familiar
        + procrastinate, avoid, and fail to finish what they start
        + make a bad situation worse by doing more of what has never worked in past
        + 
+ Developing integrity
    + decide what feels right and doing it
+ Setting boundaries
    + Do you say 'yes' when you would rather say 'no'?
    + Do you agree to do something to avoid conflict?
    + Do you tolerate an intolerable situation, hoping that it will just go away?

+ > Strength, discipline, courage, passion, persistence, integrity has potential of aggressive, destructive and brutality. This **frightens** nice guy.

## Chapter 6 ##
*I agree with some of point made in this chapter. However there is much discussion to be had*

## Other chapters ##
+ Nice guy difficulty to get love they want
    + toxic shame(they don't become vulnerable)
    + dysfunctional relationships they co-create
    + patterns of enmeshment and avoidance
        + 'enmeshment': personal boundaries are diffused, blurred .i.e. bigger bro acting as father
    + they end relationship badly(i.e via text)
+ Nice guy fear of success, they self-sabotage by
    + wasting time, making excuse
    + not finishing projects, caretaking other people
    + Having too many project going at once
    + not setting boundaries and procrastinating
+ *nice guys are typically good at appearing competent...if the don't start, it will not finish so nobody can criticize them*
+ Make conscious decision to *to face fears, to not settle for mediocrity, to make my own rules.*
+ Some rules to consider, but make your own.
    + If it frightens you, do it.
    + Don't settle. Every time you settle, you get exactly what you settled for.
    + Put yourself first.
    + No matter what happens, you will handle it.
    + whatever you do, do it one hundred percent.
    + If you do what you have always done, you will get what you have always got.
    + You are the only person on this planet responsible for your needs, wants, and happiness.*
    + **Be clear and direct** *how*
    + Have fun. If you are not having fun, something is wrong.
    + Be good to yourself.
    + Think "abundance"
    + Remove yourself from a bad situation instead of waiting for the situation to change.
    + Don't tolerate the intolerable **ever**.
    + Live with integrity. Decide what feels right to you, then do it.
    + Accept the consequences of your actions.
