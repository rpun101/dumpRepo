_attempt to understand the exisiting code artitecture_
### Working effectively ###
+ write doen the name of the last important thing that you saw
+ keep notes, pseudo UML diagrams, don't worry about correcteness of it
+ "Listing markup"
+ "Scratch Refractoring": Copy the source code to another place and play wiht it widly
+ Delete Unused codes, version control can help you to get back

### Internet ###
+ understand on the high level first(the project purpose)
+ debug on module level >>>then on class level >> figure out the dependecies
+ execute the program and understand the flow of program
	- where are business logic, data access logic
	- input and output for these modules/classes
+ always be keeping the note
+ don't try to understand the whole project(unrealistic), but **Know what you don't know**




+ create a ER diagram of the database

+ copy to another folder , version it with git, break it ad see how it work :)
+ Visaul Studio's class diagram (shos bird's-eye view)
+ stack trace
+ so there is NDepend extension to analyze all the calls
