#### Techniques ####

1. Starting and responding techniques with:
    + Emotion:
        - Happy(yay, i got a new iPhone)
        - Sad(my mail did not arrive today)
        - Mad(I told you to NOT look at MY phone.)
        - Afraid(i think.... someone is following me)
    + Physicality
        - starting with body language, like you are doing something in motion, maybe you are in pain
        - for example start like if someone is smoking outside.
    + Funny voices/Tones
        - it does not necessarily have to be cartoon/high pitch noises :)
    + Giving Names
        - (Hey Gary, what up with Nicole?)
    + Philosophical
        - it does not have to be 'i think so I am', Socrates, Plato level of things.
        - it can be like, "whenever I write, i seem to learn more, then piss someone who is reading"
        -  "we will win the game if we scored the goal first."
        - "everybody is a philosopher, until they get punch in the face"

    + Side note: I noticed John emphasizing to respond with, " I feel/am ____<emotions>___". that is a good way to enhance the story.
1. Animal morphing into human characteristics
    + Start with a momvent and sound your animal make
    + Walk around, feel how it is going/feeling
    + then slowly morph into human with some quriks of animal
    + say you are doing snake: you can move bit odd and hiss before speaking.
    + "my name, hisss, why do you need it, hissss"
1. Vocal/voice from six places.  **need more research in this topic**
    + From lower body: Village people sounding
    + Stomach
    + Chest
    + Throat
    + Nasal
    + Head/Divine: sort of clamness in voice
1. Commitment
    + if you notice yourself not feeling quite right, commit to the character more
    + double down on character, then you can feel the character and act more like that character
