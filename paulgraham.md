### Hackers & Painters ###

+ Chapter 3: [What you can't say](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html)
  + Convention has less hold over nerds.
  + the most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not to say what you want.
  + find friends, wher eyou can discuss ideas
  + How can you see the wave, when you're the water? Always be questioning. That's the only defence. What can't you say? And why?
  + "I haven't decided."
  + Conformist Test: do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?
    + yes: **think about that**
    + no: not original, you think whatever you're told; making same accidental mistake as group; unoriginal.
  + Leonardo -> Copernicous; Church were too strong so they did not have to worry about Copernicous. However, in leonardo times, church were weak to fear idea, and strong enough to enforce, so they persecuted him.
  + "idea likely true are feared". If you say, you people from Indian continent have big head the size of two basketballs, then you would be laughed at.

+ Chapter 6: [how to make a wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html)

  + _on how hard you work in startup_ the case wher eyou not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.
  + with intense focus, and hard work, without the constraint of the corporate word, it all can accumulate about 10-30 times output of current output value.
  + Conservation law: if you want to make amillion dollars, you have to endure a milliion dollars' worth of pain.
  + Make mony by creating wealth and getting paid for it. You just have to do something people want.
  + Weath is not money, it is what you want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, education and so on. Ant colony can have weath.
  + people think that what a business does i make money. But money is just the intermediate stage just a shorthand for whatever people want. what most business really do is make wealth. They do something people want. _my example_ _you offer tution_ _in milanchow, people used to make a bridge while water were high, and make money out of it_
  + Pie fallacy: Belief that there is limited about of wealth in world. In other to gain wealth, somebody has to lose. It is false because MONEY does not equal to wealth.
  + you need to start doing something peole want. You don't need to join a company to do that. All a company is a group of pepole working together to do something people want. It's doing something people want that matters, not joining the group [for salary].
  + if you're in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage. 
  + Need both measurement & leverage. e.g. movie star, CEO of company have it. But craftsman with no say in his creative decision does not have leverage. he only has measurement.
  + small group/team = easy to measurment
  + Technology is the technique. it's the way we all do things. And when you discover a new way to to things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it. It is the proverbial fishing rod.
  + "Run upstairs" (when bully/big company is chasing). Metaphor: When big fat corporation is chasing you, run up, because they will also have to run with their weight.
  + Technical advances tend to come from unorthodox apporaches, and small companis are less constrained by convention.
  + The catch: you're 30 times as productive, and get paind between zero and a thousand times as much. If the mean is 30x. the median is probably zero.
  + number of active users(direct relation of product value).
  + In technology, you cook one thing and that's what everyone eats. So any difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied.
  + _[inovation happens by]_ allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world.

+ [Mind the Gap](http://www.paulgraham.com/gap.html)

  + Daddy Money mentality
  + ability and desire to create wealth vary person to person, its not made equally.
  + Great fortune with no apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed that it had been forgotten.
  + Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor? it will certainly increase the gab between **the productive and the unproductive**. That's the whole point of technology.
  + You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do to get rich. We need Henry Ford to be rich, because he'll make you a tractor to replace your hourse.  + Various Points on the books
  + Good design is simple. In writing it means: say what you mean and say it briefly.
  + When you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem. When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.
  + Good design is hard...**Not every kind of hard is good. There is good pain and bad pain. You want the kind of pain you get from running, not the kind you get from stepping on nail.**
  + > Authoritarian countries become corrupt; corrupt countries become poor; and poor countires are weak.
  + _on somewant wanting to start a startup but have fears_ One is that you don't know anything about business. The other is that you're afraid of competition. Neither of these fences have any current in them. Business: build something users love and make more than you spend.
  + Don't get complacent if your competitors software is lame; the standard to compare your software to is what it could be, not what your competitor have.
  + The word "essay" comes from the French verb "essayer", which means 'to try'. An essay, in the original sense, is something you write to try to figure something out.
  + In business, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.
  + If you can keep hoep and worry balanced they will drive a project forward the same way your two legs drives a bicycle forward.
  + > If you think you're designing something for idiots, odds are you're not designing something good, even for idiots.
  + _coomparing building prtotype with creating a paint_ Instead you should draw a few quick lines in roughly in the right place, and then gradually refine this initial sketch.
  + > Morale is key in design... Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged. In software, my rule is **always have working code. If you're writing something you'll be able to test in an hour, you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.**
