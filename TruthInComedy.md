# Truth in Comedy

_succinct guide to improv. important notes. does not expand more on topics but you will know if you have been doing improv for a while. must read for any improviser_

## 1. What is Improv, Anyway?
+ Be honest
+ Don't go for the jokes. _kills the story_
+ There's nothing funnier than the truth
## 2. But Seriously, Folks
+ Don't make jokes
+ Let humor arise out of the situation
+ Take the scene seriously
+ Agreement is the only rule that cannot be broken
+ > the more ridiculous the situation, the more seriously it must be played; the actors must be **totally committed** to their characters and play them with **complete integrity** to achieve maximum laughs.
+ > If a player begins making jokes at the expenses of the scene, he has nothing to fall back on when the jokes fail. If a scene is not getting laughs, however, the performers don't need to worry, as long as they are being true to their scene. They only need to be patient. The laughs will come soon enough from connections  -- and the connections cannot be avoided.
## 3. Support and Trust
 + Respect choices made by others
 + There are no bad ideas
 + There are no mistakes. Everything is justified
 + Treat others as if they are poets, geniuses and artists, they will be
 + The best way to look good is **to make your fellow players look good.**
 + > In other words, justify! if a scene fails because a player makes a wrong move, the whole group must share the blame if they didn't justify the move.
## 4. Agreement
+ Yes, and ....Accept and Build
+ > Ad game: In an add game, the word "or" should never be used. _goal is to agree and come up with ad quickly_

## 5. Initiations and Game Moves
+ make assumptions -- don't ask questions
+ Look for the games within your scene and play it.
+ Listen and remember
+ Listen for the whole idea in a statement
+ Avoid preconceived notions
+ > the best initiations make assumptions, usually about their relationship, roles, or locations.
+ > An improviser must consider what is said, and what is left unsaid, as well. he must think, "Why was that said? What does she mean by that? How does it makes me **feel**?"
## 6. Moment to Moment to Moment
+ Stay in the moment. What is happening now will be the key to discovery.
+ Nothing is ignored. Follow the unexpected twist.
+ there is no such thing as a mistake
+ _Respect the audience_
+ > "Always assume audience is one step ahead of you."
## 7. Building a Scene
+ Keep it simple. Less is more
+ Avoid exposition
+ Start scenes in the middle
+ Take the active choice to forward action
+ Be specific. Avoid generalities
+ Listen for the game move.
+ Welcome the silences. There is action in thought
+ > "Active choices forward the scene. Passive choices keep it stagnant. There's really no choice, is there?"
+ > **silence is golden** An improviser needs to consider the most intelligent response he can give to a statement, and so he must feel he can take the time to stop and think. These moments of silence make a beginning improviser very nervous.
## 8. One Mind, Many Bodies
+ Take unusual choice.
+ Listen to your inner voice
+ Reflect each other's ideas
+ > Very often, when a beginning improviser gets the impulse to say or do something in a scene, he ignores it...only real mistake here is ignoring the inner voice. 
+ > The unusual choices result in the most interesting scenes.

## 9. Environmentally Aware
+ commit to the physical
+ let your environment affect you
+ be specific with your objects
+ reveal yourself through your character
## 10. Responsibilities of a Harold Player
+ Find your function or role in every game
## 11. How to do a Harold
+ The suggestions is the inspiration to discover the theme
